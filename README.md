Introduction to programming for Mathematics
=====================================================

This is the mini-course in programming for first year physics and
astronomy students at the University of Amsterdam. It is a fast paced
course that is designed to be given in two days. Every first day
contains a little bit of theory, small exercises and a few larger 
exercises for more experienced students (hacker edition).

The course is mostly based on MIT's 6.189 and 6.00, both of which are
available at http://ocw.mit.edu/
